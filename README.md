cursedvga is a command line tool that uses NCurses to decode and display TGA images. In adherence to NCurses' limitations (and because I think its neat) colors are mapped to their nearest match within an 8-bit color palette.

Currently, cursedvga only supports a subset of TGA image types, that being run-length encoded RGB images (without a color map).
